    <p class="tip">Power troubles may soon be solved</p>

    <p>China is expected to see its power shortages substantially eased beginning in the next half
        of this year, according to a senior official with the China Electricity Council (CEC)
        yesterday.</p>

    <p>"Power supply and demand will be balanced nationwide in the next of the year, although
        short-term power shortages will still exist in a few regions," said CEC secretary-general
        Wang Yonggan.</p>

    <p>Power shortages only existed in four provinces in June, compared with 25 at the beginning of
        2005 and nine in January.</p>

    <p>Wang said power shortages had been remarkably relieved in the first six months of this year
        because more newly built large power stations were put into use.</p>

    <p>In the first half of this year, China saw a newly installed power capacity of 32.41 million
        kilowatts, 11.1 percent of which is from hydro power stations and 88.48 percent from thermal
        power plants. </p>
